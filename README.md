# Folder Structure
I'd like to keep the folder structure relatively "simple". For now we have the Twitter Folder (currently with Auth.cs and Tokens.cs in).
This will contain most of the Twitter funcionality (Tweeting, Following, Re-Tweeting etc.). Soon There will also be a folder called Auth.
You guessed it, this folder will contain all the Authentification needed to connect to twitter. So Auth.cs and Tokens.cs will move here probably.
