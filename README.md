# LexiTwitter
Potential Twitter AI project

# Folder Structure
I'd like to keep the folder structure relatively "simple". For now we have the Twitter Folder (currently with Auth.cs and Tokens.cs in).
This will contain most of the Twitter funcionality (Tweeting, Following, Re-Tweeting etc.). Soon There will also be a folder called Auth.
You guessed it, this folder will contain all the Authentification needed to connect to twitter. So Auth.cs and Tokens.cs will move here probably.

## this project is a part of the EmberOfDreams organisation.
Please go to https://www.github.com/emberofdreams for other projects in the future. This repo is only the inital repo (with updates of course) When v0.1.0 is finalized we will move all production to the emberofdreams repository.
